    "1. What I got most wrong on\n",
    "- Mostly code blocks, like finding errors and solving them, finding the right results of the code, and which code does not work as intended.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. How I am going to improve\n",
    "- I am going to go over the videos and read the materials Mr. Mort provided us with the collegeboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What I learned\n",
    "- The MCQ helped me identify which part of the CSP and the MCQ that I am weak at. It gave me an opportunity to go back and reflect why I got the questions wrong, and how I should fix it. It helped me a lot with studying for AP exam because it is a good material to look at for studying the MCQ with similar questions for practice. \n",

    "# Top 5 things I need to learn\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. 3.11: Binary Search\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Qestion 47:  The procedure BinarySearch (numList, target) correctly implements a binary search algorithm on the list of numbers numList. The procedure  returns an index where target occurs in numList, or -1 if target does not occur in numList.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Which of the following conditions must be met in order for the procedure to work as intended?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Response: I chose The list numList must not contain any duplicate values because I thought binary search should not contain any duplicate values, but In order for a binary search on a list to work as intended, the list must be sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. 3.17: Algorithmic Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "- Q56: Compare execution times of two versions (Learn how to read them)\n",
    "\n",
    "    I chose Version II requires approximately 1 more minute to execute than version I. but the answer was  Version I calls the GetPrediction procedure once for each element of idList, or four times total. Since each call requires 1 minute of execution time, version I requires approximately 4 minutes to execute. Version II calls the GetPrediction procedure twice for each element of idList, and then again in the final display statement. This results in the procedure being called nine times, requiring approximately 9 minutes of execution time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Q50: Reasonable time algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "    Question: Consider the following algorithms. Each algorithm operates on a list containing n elements, where n is a very large integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "    I: An algorithm that accesses each element in the list twice\n",
    "    II: An algorithm that accesses each element in the list n times\n",
    "    III: An algorithm that accesses only the first 10 elements in the list, regardless of the size of the list\n",
    "\n",
    "    Which of the algorithms run in reasonable time?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Responses: I chose III only because first 10 elements seemed to run faster than accessing all elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "    The answer was all because Algorithm I accesses elements times (twice for each of n elements), which is considered reasonable time. Algorithm II accesses elements (n times for each of n elements), which is considered reasonable time.\n",

    "    Answer: There exist some problems that cannot be solved using any algorithm. \n",

    "    Answer: Changing line 5 to APPEND (newList, number) / The given code segment traverses originalList from left to right and inserts all even elements at the beginning of newList. Repeatedly inserting these elements at the beginning of newList causes newList to have the copied elements appear in reverse order compared to their order in originalList.

    "    Answer: Lines 5 and 6 should be interchanged. / As is, the program does not include the first element of the list in the sum because i is incremented before nums[i] is added to sum.
