    "I regularly use a streaming service for watching movies and TV shows. I've noticed that the recommendations often favor popular mainstream content and don't cater well to different user groups, such as those who prefer international films or genres. This bias might be caused by the algorithm prioritizing content with higher engagement metrics and a lack of diverse testing. To reduce bias and make the platform more inclusive, developers could incorporate user preferences more effectively by allowing users to specify their interests and providing a wider range of recommendations based on those inputs."
