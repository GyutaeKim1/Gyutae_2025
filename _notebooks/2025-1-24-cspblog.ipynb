    "The purpose of my groups program is to help club leaders and members in Del Norte High School to communicate easily through our platform. The website helps keep control and organize events, announcements, leaderships, and members. Students can also discover a club based on their interests. This will help students increase interest in joining clubs. Often, clubs don't have a place where they can communicate. Some clubs use instagram, some use group chat, and some clubs don't have one. But, with this website, all the clubs will be able to communicate on the same space. \n",

    "My code manages event data using Python data structures and a database. Events are stored in the database, with each row represented as a dictionary, where keys correspond to column names. The Event class handles CRUD operations like creating events with create_event() or updating them using update_event(). SQLAlchemy manages database interactions, and data is formatted into dictionaries using to_dict() for consistent frontend integration.\n",

    "API requests are structured using class-based methods for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE operations. GET retrieves events, POST creates new ones, PUT updates existing records, and DELETE removes them. These methods use SQLAlchemy for database queries, applying sequencing, selection, and iteration for logic. Responses are formatted as JSON using Flask's jsonify() to ensure seamless communication with the frontend.\n",
