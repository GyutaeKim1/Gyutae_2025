    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Project: Redesign, Improve student_2026 starter repo\n",
    "\n",
    "- The goal of this project was to enhance the existing student_2026 starter repository by improving its design, structure, and functionality to create a better user experience and more maintainable codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We started by analyzing the original repo to identify areas for improvement such as layout inconsistencies, outdated styles, and redundant or unclear code. Then, we redesigned the website’s interface to be more modern and user-friendly, using clean, responsive design principles that work well across different devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Throughout the project, we practiced collaborative development by dividing the work into sections assigned to each teammate. We carefully coordinated commits and pull requests to prevent conflicts and maintain a stable codebase. This process included regular communication to discuss progress, review each other’s work, and solve any issues as they arose.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We also had a lot of stand up meetings and communication between Kush's group and Mihir's group to merge our projects together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Project: Club Hub\n",
    "\n",
    "Project from tri 2\n",
    "\n",
    "- The purpose of my individual feature is to let presidents and other leaders of a club to announce events and make events easily. For example, if there is a competition, the president simply has to type their event on the form and click create on events tab, and other members will be able to view the event. In the form, there is club name part, which you can drag your mouse and click your club, event description, and the date of the event.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Club Events Feature was developed to address the lack of organization and engagement in club-related activities. Many clubs struggle with effectively planning and managing events, leading to low participation and miscommunication among members. So, by using club events, I hope to let club leaders help label different events in one space to make club members easier to see the announcements or events. The feature increases club engagement and encourages active participation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The events feature also includes a calendar, where users can view which date has an event easily without scrolling untill they find an event. There will be a white dot when there is an event that day. The events are also going to be displayed on the homepage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The club leaders / event creaters can edit or delete the event. only the event creater, which is the president can edit or delete their clubs’ events.\n",
    "\n",
    "### My unique Skills\n",
    "\n",
    "-My Unique qualities: Teamwork, communication skill, effort. I work with my teammates and communicate a lot. For example, as we start to commit, we divide our parts and integrate to one so that the website doesn't break. I also try to solve any problems by myself instead of asking for help right away when there is a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Teamwork\n",
    "- I collaborated closely with my group to divide tasks effectively. We made sure to assign different parts of the site to each member and merge responsibly to avoid breaking changes. I consistently made sure my part aligned with the team’s goals and code structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Communication Skills\n",
    "- Throughout the project, I emphasized clear and frequent communication—especially when pushing commits or coordinating merge requests. We used GitHub and verbal check-ins to stay aligned and avoid conflicts. If I noticed something off in a teammate’s code or saw room for improvement, I provided constructive feedback respectfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Effort and Independence\n",
    "When faced with bugs or confusion, I made it a habit to debug independently first, using online resources or inspecting the code carefully. I only reached out for help when I had already tried solving it myself, which helped me learn more and become more confident in my problem-solving skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What I Gained\n",
    "\n",
    "This project helped me strengthen real-world development habits like:\n",
    "- Version control using Git/GitHub\n",
    "- Working in a shared codebase\n",
    "- Coordinating changes and managing conflicts\n",
    "- Balancing individual responsibility with group collaboration\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What I need to improve on\n",
    "\n",
    "- time management: I am not good at time management and I sometimes finish overdue. I am going to fix this by using calendar and make schedule for myself to remind me of due dates.\n",
    "- advanced coding skill: I do not have advanced coding skills like others, and I am going to imrpove this by watching different coding skills.\n",

    "\n",
    "We showcased our project in N@tM by first explaining the purpose of our project. The purpose is to make a demo website for future students to use for their portfolio. All the projects, email, linkedin, resume, and more are in the repository, so it is easier for them to switch. We also have theme switching logic for students to easily switch the theme. Tailwind is integrated in the student_2026 repo. There are also lessons and other features for students to study with good tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "What did I learn?\n",
    "- I learned that there are many unique ideas that I have never thought of. For example Mihir's group made the tool for helping students manage lessons. It was interesting to me because there are whiteboards and notes tool to help students expand on their thoughts.\n",
    "- In first trimester, we didn't know what to do and was nervous, but now we know how to pitch and explain important parts. \n",
    "- It reminded me of importance of sharing my idea and my journey to other people. It can give me opportunities. \n",
    "- I look forward to more opportunities to present, reflect, and learn from the peers that are learning just like me.\n",
