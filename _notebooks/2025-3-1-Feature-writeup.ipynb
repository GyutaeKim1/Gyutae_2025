    "Purpose: The purpose of my individual feature is to let presidents and other leaders of a club to announce events and make events easily. For example, if there is a competition, the president simply has to type their event on the form and click create on events tab, and other members will be able to view the event. In the form, there is club name part, which you can drag your mouse and click your club, event description, and the date of the event. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Club Events Feature was developed to address the lack of organization and engagement in club-related activities. Many clubs struggle with effectively planning and managing events, leading to low participation and miscommunication among members. So, by using club events, I hope to let club leaders help label different events in one space to make club members easier to see the announcements or events. The feature increases club engagement and encourages active participation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The events feature also includes a calendar, where users can view which date has an event easily without scrolling untill they find an event. There will be a white dot when there is an event that day. The events are also going to be displayed on the homepage. \n",
    "\n",
    "The club leaders / event creaters can edit or delete the event. only the event creater, which is the president can edit or delete their clubs' events. "

    "\n",
    "1. Events Frontend\n",
    "\n",
    "    - I matched the css styling with other group mates, which shows my collaboration skill and how we communicate with each other often.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The event form allows club leaders to create or update events. The form is displayed when the user clicks the \"Create a New Event\" button When the form is submitted, the input data (event name, description, date, and associated club) is collected and sent to the backend API via a POST request. If editing an existing event, the form fields are pre-filled with the event’s data, and the form sends a PUT request to update the event.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Club Selection Dropdown: To associate an event with a club, the form includes a dropdown list of clubs created by the logged-in user. The list of clubs is fetched from the backend, and only those created by the club leader are displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Event List Display: The events are displayed in a paginated list. Each event includes the title, description, and date. The events are sorted by date in descending order (latest first).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Calendar Integration: The calendar view shows the days of the month, with event dots on the dates that have events. Users can click on a specific day to see all events scheduled for that day. The calendar is dynamically generated and updated based on the current month and year. Users can navigate between months using previous and next month buttons, and the event list will refresh based on the new month selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Edit / delete : Only the event creater, which is club president can view the buttons. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Events Backend\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Event CRUD Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Create (POST): Allows users to create new events by providing a title, description, and date. The data is validated to ensure all required fields are provided. If valid, a new Event object is created and stored in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Read (GET): Retrieves and returns all events stored in the database as a list of dictionaries. Each event is converted into a JSON-friendly dictionary using the to_dict() method of the Event model.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Update (PUT): Allows updating an existing event by its ID. The event's fields can be modified, and the changes are saved back to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Delete (DELETE): Allows an authenticated user to delete an event by its ID. The event is removed from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The EventAPI._USER class retrieves events for a specific user. It ensures that only authenticated users can access their own events by filtering the events using the user’s ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The Event class represents the event data in the database. This class is defined using SQLAlchemy\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Made an data table called events\n",

    "3. backend UI for Club Hub Admin Page\n",
    "\n",
    "    - styling (css)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The background uses a gradient from #FF4B2B to #FF416C for a vibrant and dynamic feel.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Custom buttons are styled with gradients and bold uppercase text, creating a professional yet stylish UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - External Link button: Contains a button to direct users to the frontend website of Club Hub.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - User/Club Management button: Provides links to manage users and clubs, where the admin can edit, delete, or add them.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Added descriptions and pictures to Admin Page\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Backend Clubs Table\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Styling & Theme\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Club Data Display: Clubs are displayed in a table with the columns ID, Name, Description, Topics, and Actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Edit and Delete Buttons: Admin users can edit or delete clubs via modals.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Add Club Button: There's an \"Add Club\" button that opens a modal to create a new club.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Only admin can control them\n",
