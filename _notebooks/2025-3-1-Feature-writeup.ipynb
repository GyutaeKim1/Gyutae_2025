    "Purpose: The purpose of my individual feature is to let presidents and other leaders of a club to announce events and make events easily. For example, if there is a competition, the president simply has to type their event on the form and click create on events tab, and other members will be able to view the event. In the form, there is club name part, which you can drag your mouse and click your club, event description, and the date of the event. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Club Events Feature was developed to address the lack of organization and engagement in club-related activities. Many clubs struggle with effectively planning and managing events, leading to low participation and miscommunication among members. So, by using club events, I hope to let club leaders help label different events in one space to make club members easier to see the announcements or events. The feature increases club engagement and encourages active participation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The events feature also includes a calendar, where users can view which date has an event easily without scrolling untill they find an event. There will be a white dot when there is an event that day. The events are also going to be displayed on the homepage. \n",
    "\n",
    "The club leaders / event creaters can edit or delete the event. only the event creater, which is the president can edit or delete their clubs' events. "

    "    - The event form allows club leaders to create or update events. The form is displayed when the user clicks the \"Create a New Event\" button When the form is submitted, the input data (event name, description, date, and associated club) is collected and sent to the backend API via a POST request. If editing an existing event, the form fields are pre-filled with the event’s data, and the form sends a PUT request to update the event.\n",
