    "1. Feedback: Improving Based on User feedbacks\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Feedback from N@tm suggested better frontend / the purpose is minimal\n",
    "    - improvements like adding event descriptions and filtering events by date.\n",
    "    - ensuring presidents could only modify their own events.\n",
    "    - Ensure that an event cannot be created without a title, description, or date.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Testing: Ensuring Functionality and usefulness\n",
    "\n",
    "    - testing CRUD functions using postman\n",
    "    - On deployed website, I checked with my friend if they can see what I typed on my conputer\n",
    "    - I asked my friends if my feature looked okay.\n",
    "    - I tested with using president account and user account to see if only president can add the events, edit, and delete.\n",
    "\n",
    "    How Testing Improved the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Identified and fixed issues where event updates failed due to improper data formatting.\n",
    "    - Added better error messages when events were not found or when duplicate events were attempted.\n",
    "    - Strengthened security by restricting event modifications to the event creator / president only.\n",

    "3. Reflection: Enhancing Future Development\n",
    "\n",
    "    - After completing the initial version of the club events feature, I reflected on ways to improve efficiency and user experience\n",
    "    - After testing, I realized that navigating between clubs and their events could be smoother. I plan to improve the UI with better navigation.\n",
    "    - I considered future scalability—how the event system could support larger clubs or even public events outside clubs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Iterative Development: Making Continuous Improvements\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - I made so that instead of typing the club, club leader automatically gets to choose an option instead of typing it\n",
    "    - I added dates and description for events \n",
    "    - I added authentication to backend so only event creater can edit or delete it. \n",
    "    - I also added dots to the calender when there is an event that day"

The procedure breaks down the update process into smaller tasks by checking each attribute individually.\n",
