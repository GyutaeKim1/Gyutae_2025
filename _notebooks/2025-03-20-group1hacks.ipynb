    "1) Facial recognition\n",
    "\n",
    " - Original use: Facial recognition was originally developed for security and authentication purposes, such as unlocking smartphones, airport security checks, and verifying identities in banking.\n",
    " - New use: Using Facial Recognition to Identify Missing Children in Public Places\n",
    " - benefit: Increases the chances of finding a missing child.\n",
    " - risk: Potential privacy concerns\n",
    "\n",
    "### HW Hack 2\n",
    "\n",
    " - Problem: Misinformation\n",
    " - AI generated misinformation can cause hatred, affect one negatively, and might cause violence among people. When false informations go viral, they can create division, fear, and distrust in society, making it harder to find if its truth or lies. \n",
    " - solution 1: Make an AI tool that detects misinformations and flag them. By detecting misinformations, websites could be more trusted and reliable since non flagged websites include facts. \n",
    " - Solution 2: Have the human check the each works and identify the false informations.\n",
    " - Reflection: AI is powerful, but it can be used to manipulate truth. Ethical AI development is important to prevent harm and and have facts in websites.. By combining AI detection with human oversight, we can reduce the spread of misinformation.\n",

    " - AI Example: AI Chatbot Spreading Misinformation\n",
    " - Summarize What Happened: Microsoftâ€™s Bing Chat AI spread false information, including conspiracy theories, instead of accurate responses.\n",
    " - Response: Microsoft updated the AI with stricter moderation, conversation limits, and disclaimers.\n",
    " - Prevention: Stronger fact-checking, trusted data sources, and human oversight could have prevented this.\n",
