    "1. Feedbacks: \n",
    "\n",
    "    This is rlly cool good job on ur club hub project - neil c\n",
    "\n",
    "    I really like your styling and how your features are integrated and make sense when used together, especially the leadership application and the create club features, very innovative. - Kiruthic`\n",
    "\n",
    "    I really like how mnany options you have but next time you can make the theme a bit more connected and less choppy with containers - Rohan\n",
    "\n",
    "    This is very cool annd relatable as it has a little list showing interests but just add a theme next time and make it look a little better - Arhaan\n",
    "\n",
    "    This is really nice! I love the red color scheme and how each feature is integrated with each other. I would recommend letting the user be able to add their own interests that are not on the list. - Aadi\n",
    "\n",
    "    This is a very nice looking website, but the purpose is quite minimal - in terms of actually helping people with choosing or managing clubs - Nikhil\n",
    "\n",
    "    This website is really cool and has very good applications in the real world since people can use this website to choose what club to join or other things relating to clubs. I would recommend making the frontend a bit better. - Aaditya\n",
    "\n",
    "    The idea of this website is actually quite innovative, you can tell the execution went through well and the idea of clubs in a real world application itself works very well. - Armaghan Z.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The UI design is great! One thing I think you can improve on is the admin features, making it so admin can only edit the actual crud functions. Overall great project- Tarun Rayavarapu\n",
    "\n",
    "    Great project veery relavant to school students\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What I learned: The feature overall was useful and can be used in real world. The features are integraded together and make sense. However, we got feedback that adding a theme and styling better like containers would be better. \n",

    "\n",

    "# Reflection on individual strengths, weaknesses\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Strength\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Collaboration: I collaborated with my group members to connect each others' features together so it is interconnected with each other. We tried to make it useful for actual students to use it. We helped each other when we needed them and give ideas to each others' features.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Communication: We had a group chat and we constantly talked with each other to get everyone on the same track without one person not being able to do it. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - planning: We made kanban board and constantly updated our burndown list so that we are organized and we finish everything we planned out. We also had standup meetings often to plan out what we are going to do each day. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Curiosity and learning: We asked each other if I had any questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Weakness\n",
    "\n",
    "    - time management: I poorly managed my time. Even though I have planned out, I often couldn't finish it on time and had to do more. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Over-Reliance on Others: I was reliying on my group members often. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Difficulty with Abstract Thinking: Some computer science concepts, like algorithms or data structures, require thinking abstractly. I was having hard time understanding certain algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reflection on project by creating next steps plans, strengths, weaknesses\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Next Steps for Strengths:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Continue to have collaboration and communication with my peers to stay on track and improve team efficiency.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Maintain using the Kanban board and burndown lists to stay organized. Keep having standup meetings for daily planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Next Steps for Weaknesses:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Time Management: Break tasks into smaller chunks, set realistic deadlines, and avoid multitasking. Using a timer to stay on track.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Over-Reliance on Others: Take ownership of more individual tasks and focus on personal accountability. If I need help, I should be specific about what I need rather than relying on others for everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Abstract thinking: Read over college board materials watch videos to understand different algorithems and concepts that I didn't get it before.\n",

    "1. **5 Things Over 12 Weeks Issues, Burndown, Presentation**:\n",
    "   - **Grade**: 4.5/5  \n",
    "   - **Reasoning**: I successfully contributed to 5 major things across the project. The Kanban board, team collaboration, and regular standups kept us on track. However, there were a few instances my issues were a little not organized and I struggled to have 5 things I did over 12 weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Full Stack Project Demo (2 points)**:\n",
    "   - **Grade**: 1.8/2  \n",
    "   - **Reasoning**: We demonstrated the features effectively, and incorporated feedback from the Not at the Moment (N@tM) demo to improve the final product. I actively participated in both presenting and troubleshooting. However we did not meet all the CPT requirements and we had a little trouble explaining codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Project Feature Blog Write-Up (1 point)**:\n",
    "   - **Grade**: 1/1  \n",
    "   - **Reasoning**: The write-up was done with an attempt to use CPT/FRQ language. I used cause, reasoning, and fix/reflection to write it. \\I believe it lacked a bit of depth in terms of technical detail and could have been improved to reflect a clearer, more thorough explanation of our project's functionality. But, I think I can learn through college board videos and reading them and the materials Mr. Mort provided us. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **MCQ (1 point)**:\n",
    "   - **Grade**: 1/1  \n",
    "   - **Reasoning**: The MCQ was straightforward, and I couldn't get all the questions right. However, I wrote a reflection on it and analyzed top 5 topics I need to improve before taking the actual exam. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **10th point**:\n",
    "   - **Grade**: 0.8/1  \n",
    "   - **Reasoning**: I think I am not good enough to impress Mr. Mort, but I completed all the recommendations for 10th points and I went to n@tm to show interest in other groups. I saw a group with traveling app to Paris, and I saw how useful it is when we are traveling. I also noticed a group called Pawnsy and they inroduced a chess analyzer. I gave a lot of groups feedbacks and I listend to them. I also worked with Kush to practice for the Final Exam and get final exam materials organized. My group also practiced with Ms Pataki. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Final Reflection**:\n",
    "   - **Total**: 9.2/10\n",
    "   - **Summary**: I think my performance across these topics is not bad, especially in the  collaboration areas. Thereâ€™s still room for improvement in my individual contributions. I am lacking compared to other group members but I completed the requirements and I tried really hard to achieve my goal. I especially worked with my teammates to achieve the goal and help each other. While completing the requirements, I learn a lot of things. I learned which areas I am weak on and which areas I am strong in. I can use this experience to not only trimester 3, but through my life. \n",
