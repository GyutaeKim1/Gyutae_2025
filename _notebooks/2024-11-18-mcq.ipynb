    "# What did you learn from the quiz?\n",
    "\n",
    "I learned a lot of things through completing the quiz. I gained dbetter understanding of how to prepare and study for the AP exam for CSP. There were questions based on common sense, but there were questions that required my knowledge and think hard with critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Because I wasn't able to get some problems, I reviewed and searched up how to solve them and how it works. Then, I was able to understand the material better and be more prepared for the AP test.\n",

    "# What type of questions do you feel you are week on?\n",
    "\n",
    "I felt like I was week on visual codes. Reading the code and finding mistakes or finding which sentence fits the code was challenging for me because before, I had a little knowledge of how to read and find mistakes. But, after this, I was able to understand better and find mistakes. I sometimes misread loop conditions or the flow of logic, leading to errors. \n",

    "Q41: Consider the two programs below and find which of the followings best compares the values displayed by programs A and B. \n",
    "\n",
    "I chose D initially, which was Program A and program B display a different number of values. But the answer was program A and program B display the same number of values, but the values differ because both grograms display ten values. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q17: Directions: The question or incomplete statement below is followed by four suggested answers or completions. Select the one that is best in each case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of the following actions could be used to help reduce the digital divide?\n",
    "\n",
    "I.   Providing free education and training on how to use computing devices\n",
    "II.  Providing free or low-cost computing devices to low-income individuals\n",
    "III. Providing networks and infrastructure to people in remote areas\n",
    "\n",
    "Corrections: I chose C at first because I thought it was only one and two, but it was also three beucase Free education and training would address digital literacy and would reduce the digital divide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q37: The two code segments below are each intended to display the average of the numbers in the list One word, num List. Assume that One word, num List contains more than one value. Which of the following best describes the two code segments?\n",
    "\n",
    "Correction: I chose Code segment II displays the correct average, but code segment I does not at first, but the answer was Both code segments display the correct average, but code segment I requires more arithmetic operations than code segment II because  Both code segments display the correct average. Code segment I requires more arithmetic operations because it performs the operation sum divided by LENGTH, open parenthesis, num List, close parenthesis within the loop, while code segment II performs the same operation only once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q42: Internet protocol version 4 (IPv4) represents each IP address as a 32-bit binary number. Internet protocol version 6 (IPv6) represents each IP address as a 128-bit binary number. Which of the following best describes the result of using 128-bit addresses instead of 32-bit addresses? \n",
    "\n",
    "Correction: I chose 2^4 at first, but answer was 2^96 because  IPv6 has 2 raised to the ninety sixth power times as many possible addresses as IPv4. And also 2^4 is too small. I didn't know how to read bits at first. That is why I got it wrong, but then I researched and got the answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q43: An online retailer uses an algorithm to sort a list of n items by price. The table below shows the approximate number of steps the algorithm takes to sort lists of different sizes. Based on the values in the table, which of the following best characterizes the algorithm for very large values of n ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Corrections: I chose The algorithm runs, but not in reasonable time at first, but the answer was The algorithm runs in reasonable time becuase The pattern in the table appears to indicate that there are n squared steps for a list containing n items. This number of steps is a polynomial and therefore the algorithm runs in reasonable time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q45: A NAND gate is a type of logic gate that produces an output of false only when both of its two inputs are true. Otherwise, the gate produces an output of true. Which of the following Boolean expressions correctly models a NAND gate with inputs P and Q ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Correction: I chose Open parenthesis, NOT P, close parenthesis, and Q because I didn't understand NAND at first, so the answer was NOT, open parenthesis, P AND Q, close parenthesis The expression P AND Q evaluates to true when both P and Q are true, and evaluates to false otherwise. Therefore, the expression NOT, open parenthesis, P AND Q, close parenthesis evaluates to false when both P and Q are true, and evaluates to true otherwise.\n",

    "Q48: In a certain science experiment, 7 5 percent of trials are expected to be successful and 2 5 percent of trials are expected to be unsuccessful. The program below is intended to simulate the results of repeated trials of the experiment. Which of the following can be used to replace missing code so that the simulation works as intended?\n",
    "\n",
    "Correction: I chose RANDOM, open parenthesis 1 comma 100, close parenthesis, equals 75 at first, but the answer was RANDOM, open parenthesis 1 comma 100, close parenthesis, is less than or equal to 75 because This option causes the experiment to be successful when RANDOM, open parenthesis 1 comma 100, close parenthesis produces a result from 1 to 7 5, or 75% of the time.\n",

    "Q58: Which of the following are true statements about how the Internet enables crowdsourcing?\n",
    "\n",
    "I. The Internet can provide crowdsourcing participants access to useful tools, information, and professional knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "II. The speed and reach of the Internet can lower geographic barriers, allowing individuals from different locations to contribute to projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "III. Using the Internet to distribute solutions across many users allows all computational problems to be solved in reasonable time, even for very large input sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Responses\n",
    "\n",
    "Correction: I chose I, II, and III at first, but the answer was I and II only becuase The Internet can provide tools, information, and knowledge to crowdsourcing participants and can lower geographic barriers to potential participants. However, there exist problems that cannot be solved in reasonable time, even with a distributed approach.\n",

    "Q63: The program below is intended to count the number of prime numbers in a list called numbers and display the result. The program uses the procedure One word, is Prime, open parenthesis, n, close parenthesis, which returns true if n is a prime number and false otherwise. Which two lines of code should be removed so that the program will work as intended?\n",
    "\n",
    "Correction: I chose Line 1 and line 9 at first, but the answer was line 4 and line 9 because for line 4,  If count is set to 0 repeatedly inside the loop, it will not provide an accurate count of the number of prime\n",

    "D\n",
    "Cloud computing has reduced concerns about intellectual property rights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correction: I chose A and B at first, but the answer was B and C because for C, Cloud computing sites must consider security concerns in order to protect their usersâ€™ private data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q65: A program is created to perform arithmetic operations on positive and negative integers. The program contains the following incorrect procedure, which is intended to return the product of the integers x and y. A programmer suspects that an error in the program is caused by this procedure. Under which of the following conditions will the procedure NOT return the correct product?\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose B and C at first, but the answer was B and D because if y is negative, the operation will not stop because the numbers can not be negative. "
