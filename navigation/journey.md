I made a button using this code.

![Button Image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/button.png)

Then, I made a box around it using this code. 

![stylecode2]({{site.baseurl}}/images/style2.png)

![stylecode1]({{site.baseurl}}/images/style1.png)

I had trouble change the theme of my blog post. 
<p>First, I added this code.</p>

![customlayout]({{site.baseurl}}/images/customlayout.png)

<p>Then I made a .md file in _posts. But, it didn't change the theme. </p> 

So, I tried changing layout as custon-layout, and it worked.

At first, I didn't know what pseudocode is. I tried to make an example, but I had no idea. So, I watched tutorials and asked chatgpt to learn about pseudocode. Then I learned that pseuducode is a description designed for human reading rather than machine reading. Pseudocode is written in plain language, making it easy for anyone to understand the logic, regardless of their programming background. So, that is where I realized that capitalizing if, elif, and else would make a pseuducode.
