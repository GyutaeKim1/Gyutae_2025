I made a button using this code.

![Button Image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/button.png)

Then, I made a box around it using this code. 

![stylecode2]({{site.baseurl}}/images/style2.png)

![stylecode1]({{site.baseurl}}/images/style1.png)

I had trouble change the theme of my blog post. 
<p>First, I added this code.</p>

![customlayout]({{site.baseurl}}/images/customlayout.png)

<p>Then I made a .md file in _posts. But, it didn't change the theme. </p> 

So, I tried changing layout as custon-layout, and it worked. 

![customlayout2]({{site.baseurl}}/images/customlayout2.png)
